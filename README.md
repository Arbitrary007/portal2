Portal 2 Linux port
=======

Portal 2 is now available on Linux as a beta.

Important: To play Portal 2 on Linux you must opt-in to the beta. You may do this by right-clicking on Portal 2 (Beta) in Steam, clicking Properties -> Betas and then select 'beta' from the drop-down. If you do not do this, Portal 2 will not run on Linux.

Also Important: If you downloaded Portal 2 when it was first released on Linux and don't hear any voices in game, you will have to navigate to your game/bin directory (most likely ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Portal 2/bin and rename the file libmiles.so to libMiles.so -- deleting Portal 2 and re-downloading it will also fix this problem, and new users will not be affected.

Please report any issues with Portal 2 on Linux here. If you run Portal 2 on OSX or Windows, please feel free to opt in to the beta as well and report any issues you encounter while running the beta as well.
